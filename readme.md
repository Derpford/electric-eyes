# Electric Eyes

There are things hiding in the dark. Vicious, deadly. You're going to be worn down by them eventually.

You can feel them watching you, through circuit and sinew, with electric eyes.

## What does this mod do?
*Electric Eyes* is a survival-horror-themed mod, inspired by Resident Evil (of course) as well as by [Nightmare Logic](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=70984).

This mod replaces weapons, items, and the player. I recommend playing with a relatively deadly monster mod--this mod was tested with [Xenomorph Madness](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=72709).

## The Guns
Most of the guns have a *laser sight* that accurately represents where outgoing shots are going to go. You can either wait for the laser to drift back to neutral before firing another shot, or use it to account for recoil. The laser sight will shake slightly for most weapons, shaking more if you're on the move.

1. Your *fists* are fairly powerful, now that you've learned to really plant your feet. You can use *altfire* with any of the other weapons (except the chainsaw) to quick-swap to your fists and throw a roundhouse that knocks enemies back. However, this attack doesn't do damage on its own. Meanwhile, the *Chainsaw* chews through smaller enemies with ease, though you can't quickswap to the fist while using it.
2. Your trusty *Pistol* hits hard and is highly accurate, with recoil that's relatively easy to manage. However, the 10-round mag limits it. Semi-auto.
3. The *Shotgun*'s 5-round tube mag is a fine price to pay for the incredible stopping power it now has. Its recoil is powerful, and it fires relatively slowly. Pump-action, with one shot per click.
4. The *Assault Cannon* is a modern take on a multi-barrel shotgun, using a set of rotary barrels to fire *fifteen* shells in rapid succession. However, it suffers from more spread than the Shotgun, and it can chew through shells much faster. Full-auto.
5. The UAC wanted a high-performance *PDW* for their soldiers, but didn't want to spend the money on licensing the existing design...so they spent the money on building their own, taking the same ammo as your pistol. The mag isn't as big as you'd expect, but it hits just as hard as the pistol, and much faster. The ergonomic design makes each individual shot's recoil less severe--but it's full-auto, so your aim will still drift over time. Full-auto.
6. The *Grenade Launcher* fires adhesive grenades that detonate 3 seconds after coming to rest (or sticking to an enemy). The explosion is deadly, but be careful not to get caught in the blast. The 3-shot tube mag is a marvel of engineering the likes of which no mortal mind can comprehend. Semi-auto.
7. The *Thunderbolt* is an experimental energy weapon with a strange recoil pattern. It has a horizontal "sweeping" pattern, with random vertical spread. A full charge can deliver far more damage than the PDW, but it eats that charge rapidly. Full-auto.
8. The *Lazarus Device*, another experimental energy weapon, has insane short-range damage potential--but its projectiles lose energy and collapse after a certain amount of time. In addition, the spiral firing pattern can make using it against smaller targets at midrange tricky. A full charge provides about 3 seconds of continuous fire. Full-auto.

## Healing
You're carrying an *Herbal Medicine Kit*, designed to take samples of plantlife, identify and separate useful compounds from them, and automatically produce first aid supplies on-the-go. Press the USER1 key to use a 'charge', healing you up to the next 'block' of your health.

If you're full on health, you can press USER1 and use a charge of your Herbal Medicine Kit to boost your health slightly. This adds up over time.

Herbs are relatively scarce. All of the *real* medical supplies were either used up or destroyed during first contact. However, you also recover from damage over time--find a safe place to rest, and you'll start recovering. You can only recover up to the end of the current 'block' of your health, though--you'll need to use your Herbal Medicine Kit to recover past that.

## Armor
Armor protects you from 50% of incoming damage. Bear in mind that while you can carry medical supplies with you, there's no convenient way to carry more armor than you can wear on your back, and no convenient way to repair your armor on the go. That damage resistance makes a big difference, but it *will* eventually be worn away.

## Ammo
Ammunition is pretty scarce, but you've got a Powder Kit that will automatically produce ammunition for you when you've got enough gunpowder. It can only produce Clips, Shells, or Grenades, though.
- 2 red +P powders will make a 5 bullet Clip.
- 2 gold shotgun-grade powders will make three shotgun shells.
- 3 blue high-explosive powders will make one HE grenade. 

## Looting
If you see a white spiral, that indicates a Loot Spot. Enemies will sometimes drop Loot Spots on death, and some decorations will also have Loot Spots. Using your *fists* near a Loot Spot will open it, potentially dropping some useful items.
